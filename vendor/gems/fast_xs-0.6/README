= fast_xs, a fast C extension for cleaning XML

== Overview

  The original fast_xs method is based on the xchar code by Sam Ruby:

    http://intertwingly.net/stories/2005/09/28/xchar.rb
    http://intertwingly.net/blog/2005/09/28/XML-Cleansing

  _why also packages a slightly modified version in the latest version
  of Hpricot (not-yet-released) that also escapes '"' to "&quot;" (which
  is optional).

  This is an exact translation (to the best of my knowledge :) of Sam's
  original implementation, so it does not escape "&quot;".  The version
  of XML::Builder packaged with Rails also uses Sam's version, and
  XML::Builder as packaged in Rails 2.0 will be automatically use
  fast_xs if available.
